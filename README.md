Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by the progressive destruction and fibrosis of
liver tissue, leading to impaired liver function. Early detection and diagnosis of cirrhosis are
crucial for effective treatment and management of the disease. This study aims to explore the
potential of supervised machine learning techniques in detecting and diagnosing cirrhosis. A
dataset comprising clinical and laboratory features of patients with and without cirrhosis is
collected.

This study demonstrates the potential of supervised machine learning techniques in the
detection and diagnosis of cirrhosis. The developed models could serve as decision support
tools for healthcare professionals, aiding in early detection and personalized treatment of
cirrhosis patients. Further research is warranted to validate these findings on larger and more
diverse datasets and to integrate the models into clinical practice.
